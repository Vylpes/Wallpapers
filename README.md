# Wallpapers

This repository contains all of the wallpapers that I use regularly on my devices. I aim to try and update this repository at least once a month with any new wallpapers I have gained.

There isn't any particular sorting for the wallpapers, its more just a way for me to dump the wallpapers in, and have the OS shuffle through them.

## Disclaimer

As I have not made these wallpapers myself I'm unable to give permission for anyone to use them commercially. If you decide to use them it would be a safe idea to keep it to personal use.

IF I HAVE A WALLPAPER HERE THATS YOURS AND YOU WANT IT REMOVED, I WILL GLADLY REMOVE IT, PLEASE LET MY KNOW BY CREATING AN ISSUE ON GITHUB (OR IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE GIT FEEL FREE TO JUST PR THE CHANGE).

## Contributions

This is more of a personal repo for myself so contributions aren't something I'm going to take seriously here, if you include wallpapers I like then I'll merge it in but don't feel bad if I don't merge your PR
